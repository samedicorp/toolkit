# toolkit

A user interface toolkit for Dual Universe

## About

This is a UI toolkit for use with Dual Universe screens.

It is being developed alongside the [Modula](https://github.com/samedicorp/modula) framework, but conceptually it's a separate thing and can be used completely standalone.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**: This is very much a work in progress. Whilst most of the Modula code already existed in a private framework, it used html/css, and didn't mess with the new rendering API.

## Examples

For an example script, see [this project](https://github.com/samedicorp/screen-test) or [this one](https://github.com/samedicorp/container-monitor).
